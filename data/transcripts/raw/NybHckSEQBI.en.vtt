00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.400
Hi! This is Rob. Welcome to Math Antics.

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.310
In this lesson, we're going to learn some really important things

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.728
about a whole branch of math called Algebra.

00:00:15.728 --> 00:00:19.808
The first thing you need to know is that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic.

00:00:19.808 --> 00:00:22.008
It follows all the rules of arithmetic

00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:26.560
and it uses the same four main operations that arithmetic is built on:

00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:30.582
addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

00:00:30.582 --> 00:00:33.135
But Algebra introduces a new element...

00:00:33.135 --> 00:00:35.755
the element of the unknown.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.552
When you were learning arithmetic,

00:00:37.552 --> 00:00:41.537
the only thing that was ever unknown was the answer to the problem.

00:00:41.537 --> 00:00:46.205
For example, you might have the problem 1 + 2 = what?

00:00:46.205 --> 00:00:50.106
The answer isn't known until you go ahead and do the arithmetic.

00:00:50.106 --> 00:00:54.641
Now the important thing about Algebra is that when we don't know what a number is yet,

00:00:54.641 --> 00:00:56.792
we use a symbol in its place.

00:00:56.792 --> 00:00:59.910
that symbol is usually just any letter of the alphabet.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.470
A really popular letter to choose is the letter 'x'.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:09.296
So in arithmetic, we would just leave the problem like this: 1 + 2 = "blank"

00:01:09.296 --> 00:01:12.331
and we'd write in the answer when we did the addition.

00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:17.650
But in Algebra, we'd write it like this:  1 + 2 = x

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.951
The 'x' is a place holder that stands for the number that we don't know yet.

00:01:21.951 --> 00:01:26.319
What we have here is a very basic algebraic equation.

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:31.020
An equation is just a mathematical statement that two things are equal.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.140
An equation says, "the things on this side of the equal sign

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.940
have the same value as the things on the other side of the equal sign."

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.442
In this case, our equation is telling us that the known values on this side (1+2)

00:01:43.442 --> 00:01:45.361
are equal to what's on the other side,

00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:49.181
which happens to be the unknown value that we are calling 'x'.

00:01:49.181 --> 00:01:50.941
One of the main goals in Algebra

00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:53.941
is to figure out what the unknown values in equations are.

00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:57.797
And when you do that, it's called "solving the equations".

00:01:57.797 --> 00:02:02.581
In this equation, it's pretty easy to see that the unknown value is just 3.

00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:06.817
All you have to do is actually add the 1 and 2 together on this side of the equation

00:02:06.817 --> 00:02:11.485
and it turns into 3 = x, which is the same as x = 3.

00:02:11.485 --> 00:02:14.870
So now we know what 'x' is!  It's just 3.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.120
That almost seems too easy, doesn’t it?

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.320
And that's why in Algebra, you are usually given an equation in a more complicated form

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.700
like this: x - 2 = 1.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.740
This is exactly the same equation as 1 + 2 = x,

00:02:28.742 --> 00:02:33.282
but it has been rearranged so that it's not quite as easy to tell what 'x' is.

00:02:33.282 --> 00:02:36.842
So in Algebra, solving equations is a lot like a game

00:02:36.842 --> 00:02:39.420
where you are given mixed-up, complicated equations,

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:42.209
and it's your job to simplify them and rearrange them

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.480
until it is a nice simple equation (like x = 3)

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.640
where it's easy to tell what the unknown values are.

00:02:48.648 --> 00:02:50.332
We're going to learn a lot more about

00:02:50.332 --> 00:02:52.516
how you actually do that (how you solve equations)

00:02:52.516 --> 00:02:54.134
in the next several videos,

00:02:54.134 --> 00:02:56.684
but for now, let's learn some important rules about

00:02:56.684 --> 00:03:00.853
how symbols can and can't be used in algebraic equations.

00:03:00.853 --> 00:03:04.271
The first rule you need to know is that the same symbol (or letter)

00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:09.123
can be used in different algebra problems to stand for different unknown values.

00:03:09.123 --> 00:03:11.673
For example, in the problem we just solved,

00:03:11.673 --> 00:03:14.841
the letter 'x' was used to stand for the number 3, right?

00:03:14.841 --> 00:03:18.042
But 'x' could stand for a different number in a different problem.

00:03:18.042 --> 00:03:22.610
Like, if someone asks us to solve the equation, 5 + x = 10.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.470
In order for the two sides of this equation to be equal,

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.280
'x' must have the value '5' in this problem, because 5 + 5 = 10.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.098
So 'x' (or any other symbol) can stand for different values in different problems.

00:03:36.098 --> 00:03:37.299
That's okay,

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.367
but what's NOT okay is for a symbol

00:03:39.367 --> 00:03:43.547
to stand for different values in the same problem at the same time!

00:03:43.547 --> 00:03:48.500
For example, what if you had the equation: x + x = 10?

00:03:48.503 --> 00:03:52.420
This equation says that if we add 'x' to 'x' we will get 10.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.806
And there are a lot of different numbers we could add together to get 10, like 6 and 4.

00:03:57.806 --> 00:04:02.524
But, if we had the first 'x' stand for 6 and the second 'x' stand for 4,

00:04:02.524 --> 00:04:05.924
then 'x' would stand for two different value at the same time

00:04:05.924 --> 00:04:08.764
and things could get really confusing!

00:04:08.764 --> 00:04:12.244
If you wanted symbols to stand for two different numbers at the same time,

00:04:12.244 --> 00:04:16.420
you would need to use two different symbols, like 'x' and 'y'.

00:04:16.429 --> 00:04:21.231
So in Algebra, whenever you see the same symbol repeated more than once in an equation,

00:04:21.231 --> 00:04:24.415
it's representing the same unknown value.

00:04:24.415 --> 00:04:28.500
Like if you see a really complicated Algebraic equation (like this),

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.752
where 'x' is repeated a lot of different times,

00:04:31.752 --> 00:04:34.969
all of those 'x's stand for the same value,

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:38.249
and it will be your job to figure out what that value is.

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:41.238
Okay, so for any particular equation,

00:04:41.238 --> 00:04:46.023
we can't use the same letter to represent two different numbers at the same time,

00:04:46.023 --> 00:04:47.689
but what about the other way around?

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:51.225
Could we use two different letters to represent the same number?

00:04:51.225 --> 00:04:54.176
Yes! - Here's an example of that.

00:04:54.176 --> 00:04:58.036
Let's say you have the equation: a + b = 2

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.040
What could 'a' and 'b' stand for so that the equation is true?

00:05:02.045 --> 00:05:07.345
Well, If 'a' was 0 and 'b' was 2, then the equation would be true.

00:05:07.345 --> 00:05:09.085
Or, we could switch them around.

00:05:09.085 --> 00:05:13.425
If 'a' was 2 and 'b' was 0, the equation would also be true.

00:05:13.425 --> 00:05:15.085
But there's another possibility:

00:05:15.085 --> 00:05:20.340
If 'a' was 1 and 'b' was also 1, that would make the equation true, right?

00:05:20.351 --> 00:05:23.353
So, even though 'a' and 'b' are different symbols,

00:05:23.353 --> 00:05:26.404
and would usually be used to represent different numbers,

00:05:26.404 --> 00:05:30.222
there are times when they might happen to represent the same number.

00:05:30.222 --> 00:05:33.273
Oh, and this problem can help us understand something

00:05:33.273 --> 00:05:36.724
very important about how symbols are used in Algebra.

00:05:36.724 --> 00:05:40.776
Did you notice that there were different possible solution for this equation?

00:05:40.776 --> 00:05:47.327
In other words, 'b' could have the value 0, 1, or 2 depending on what the value of 'a' was.

00:05:47.327 --> 00:05:50.413
If 'a' is 0 then 'b' must be 2

00:05:50.413 --> 00:05:53.297
If 'a' is 1 then 'b' must be 1

00:05:53.297 --> 00:05:56.515
If 'a' is 2 then 'b' must be 0

00:05:56.515 --> 00:05:59.349
'b' can't have two different values at the same time,

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:03.268
but it's value can change over time if the value of 'a' changes.

00:06:03.268 --> 00:06:08.702
In Algebra, 'b' is what's called a "variable" because it's value can 'vary' or change.

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:11.982
In fact, in this equation, both 'a' and 'b' are variables

00:06:11.982 --> 00:06:16.056
because their values will change depending on the value of each other.

00:06:16.056 --> 00:06:20.723
Actually, it's really common in Algebra to refer to any letter as a variable,

00:06:20.723 --> 00:06:24.308
since letters can stand for different values in different problems.

00:06:24.308 --> 00:06:27.508
But at Math Antics, we'll usually just use the word "variable"

00:06:27.508 --> 00:06:32.228
when we're talking about values that can change or vary in the same problem.

00:06:32.228 --> 00:06:36.392
Alright, so far we've learned that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic,

00:06:36.392 --> 00:06:41.892
but that in includes unknown values and variables that we can solve for in equations.

00:06:41.892 --> 00:06:45.260
There's one other really important thing that I want to teach you

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.413
that will help you understand what's going on in a lot of Algebra problems,

00:06:49.413 --> 00:06:52.313
and it has to do with multiplication.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.180
Here are the four basic arithmetic operations:

00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:58.765
addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

00:06:58.765 --> 00:07:03.733
Although in Algebra, you'll usually see division written in fraction form, like this.

00:07:03.733 --> 00:07:07.217
In Arithmetic, all four operations have the same status,

00:07:07.217 --> 00:07:11.736
but in Algebra, multiplication get's some special treatment.

00:07:11.736 --> 00:07:15.721
In Algebra, multiplication is the 'default' operation.

00:07:15.721 --> 00:07:20.422
That means, if no other arithmetic operation is shown between two symbols,

00:07:20.422 --> 00:07:26.008
then you can just assume they're being multiplied. The multiplication is 'implied'.

00:07:26.008 --> 00:07:29.210
For example, instead of writing 'a' times 'b',

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.543
you can leave out the times symbol and just write 'ab'.

00:07:32.543 --> 00:07:35.644
Since no operation is shown between these two symbols,

00:07:35.644 --> 00:07:38.896
you know that you're supposed to multiply 'a' and 'b'.

00:07:38.896 --> 00:07:41.331
Of course, you can't actually multiply 'a' and 'b'

00:07:41.331 --> 00:07:44.030
until you figure out what numbers they stand for.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.065
The advantage of this rule about multiplication is that

00:07:47.065 --> 00:07:51.884
it makes many algebraic equations less cluttered and easier to write down.

00:07:51.884 --> 00:07:57.752
For example, instead of this: a * b + c * d = 10

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.160
You could just write: ab + cd = 10.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.540
You can also use this shorthand when you are multiplying

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:10.480
a variable and a known number... like 2x, which means the same thing as 2 times 'x'

00:08:10.491 --> 00:08:14.892
or 3y which means the same thing as 3 times 'y'

00:08:14.892 --> 00:08:17.809
Since the symbol and the number are right next to each other,

00:08:17.809 --> 00:08:19.760
the multiplication is implied.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.578
You don't have to write it down.

00:08:21.578 --> 00:08:23.378
Finally some good news!

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:27.020
Now I never have to write down that pesky multiplication symbol again!

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.320
Oh yeah!!

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.448
Ah, not so fast...

00:08:30.448 --> 00:08:35.083
there are some cases in Algebra where still need to use a multiplication symbol.

00:08:35.083 --> 00:08:38.700
For example, what if you want to show 2 x 5?

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.869
If you just get rid of the times symbol and put the '2' right next to the '5',

00:08:42.869 --> 00:08:45.419
it's going to look like the two-digit number twenty-five,

00:08:45.419 --> 00:08:48.336
which is NOT the same as 2 x 5.

00:08:48.336 --> 00:08:52.622
So, whenever you need to show multiplication between two known numbers,

00:08:52.622 --> 00:08:55.262
you still have to use the times symbol, unless...

00:08:55.262 --> 00:08:57.002
you use parentheses instead.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.880
But aren't parentheses used to show grouping in math?

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.540
How can you use that to show multiplication?

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:05.793
Ah, that's a good question.

00:09:05.793 --> 00:09:07.993
Parentheses are used to group things,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.820
but whenever you put two groups right next to each other,

00:09:10.828 --> 00:09:12.678
with no operation between them,

00:09:12.678 --> 00:09:14.538
guess what operation is implied.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.220
Yep!  Multiplication!

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.280
For example, if you see the this,

00:09:19.282 --> 00:09:24.233
it means that the group (a+b) is being multiplied by the group (x+y).

00:09:24.233 --> 00:09:27.734
We could put a times symbol between the groups, but we don't have to

00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:30.336
because it's the default operation in Algebra.

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:32.986
The multiplication is just implied.

00:09:32.986 --> 00:09:36.437
So, going back to our problem: 2 x 5

00:09:36.437 --> 00:09:40.873
If you wanted to, you could put each of the numbers inside parentheses like this,

00:09:40.873 --> 00:09:43.790
and then you could get rid of the multiplication sign.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:46.691
Now this can't be confused with the number twenty-five,

00:09:46.691 --> 00:09:48.908
and since the groups are right next to each other,

00:09:48.908 --> 00:09:51.460
you know that you need to multiply them.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:56.244
Of course, it might seem strange to have just one thing inside 'group' symbols like this,

00:09:56.244 --> 00:09:58.462
but it's okay to do that in math.

00:09:58.462 --> 00:10:00.879
An alternate way that you could do the same thing would be

00:10:00.879 --> 00:10:04.248
to put just one of the numbers in parentheses, like this.

00:10:04.248 --> 00:10:07.031
Again, you won't confuse this with a two-digit number

00:10:07.031 --> 00:10:10.117
and you know that multiplication is implied.

00:10:10.117 --> 00:10:13.967
Okay, so we've learned that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic,

00:10:13.967 --> 00:10:18.169
but it involves unknown values or variables that we need to solve for.

00:10:18.169 --> 00:10:22.387
And we learned that in Algebra, the multiplication sign is usually not shown,

00:10:22.387 --> 00:10:24.622
because it's the default operation.

00:10:24.622 --> 00:10:29.280
You can just assume that two things right next to each other are being multiplied.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.659
But why do we even care about Algebra?

00:10:31.659 --> 00:10:33.708
Is it good for anything in the 'real world'?

00:10:33.708 --> 00:10:38.228
or is it just a bunch of tricky problems that keep students busy in school?

00:10:38.228 --> 00:10:43.811
Actually, Algebra is very useful for describing or "modeling"  things in the real world.

00:10:43.811 --> 00:10:45.812
It's a little hard to see that when you are just looking

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:49.380
at all these numbers and symbols on the page of a math book.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.114
But, it's a lot easier to see

00:10:51.114 --> 00:10:55.954
when you start taking algebraic equations and graphing their solutions.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.200
Graphing an equation is like using its different solutions

00:10:59.201 --> 00:11:05.119
to draw simple lines and curves that can be used to describe and predict things in real life.

00:11:05.119 --> 00:11:08.470
For example, there's a whole class of equations in Algebra

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:12.838
called "linear" equations because they form straight lines when you graph them.

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:16.698
Those sorts of equations could help you describe the slope of a roof

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.960
or tell you how long it will take to get somewhere.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:24.020
Another class of algebraic equations, called "quadratic" equations

00:11:24.025 --> 00:11:26.326
can be used to design telescope lenses,

00:11:26.326 --> 00:11:29.428
or describe how a ball flies through the air,

00:11:29.428 --> 00:11:32.378
or predict the growth of a population.

00:11:32.378 --> 00:11:34.998
So Algebra is used all the time in fields like

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.160
science, engineering, economics and computer programming.

00:11:39.164 --> 00:11:43.583
And even though you might not need Algebra to get by in your day to day life,...

00:11:43.583 --> 00:11:48.303
...so divide both sides by 3. That means x = 42.

00:11:48.303 --> 00:11:52.243
So... in three... two... one...

00:11:52.243 --> 00:11:53.280
YES!!

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.460
Alright... now to see how much butter I need.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.680
It's still a very useful part of math.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.820
