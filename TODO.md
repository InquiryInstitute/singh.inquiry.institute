## Project Objectives

- Establish a comprehensive catalog of Khan Academy course content (videos, transcripts, exercises) to be used by Inquiry Institute.
- Map each Khan Academy course to one or more `aFaculty` personas (starting with Project Gutenberg authors such as `a.shelley`) so they can serve as teaching assistants.
- Prepare LoRA fine-tuning workflows that adapt each `aFaculty` persona to present Khan Academy course material and facilitate Q&A.
- Integrate Khan Academy resources with Inquiry Institute tooling so the `aFaculty` can guide learners through course content and track progress.

## Near-Term Tasks

- Document Khan Academy API endpoints and data schemas required for course discovery and content retrieval.
- Design the data pipeline for ingesting Khan Academy videos, transcripts, and exercises.
- Draft persona briefs for initial `aFaculty` (Project Gutenberg author set) to inform TA-style interactions and eventual LoRA training.
- Investigate storage and retrieval strategies for embedding Khan Academy content alongside `aFaculty` knowledge bases.
